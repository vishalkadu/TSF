We are exploring Prediction using Supervised ML In this task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves only 2 variables.<br>
Here we are going to answer the question that,<br> what will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?<br>
we are using Python3 to perform this task.<br>
