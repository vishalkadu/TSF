## Task 1 Students Percentage Prediction.

We are exploring Prediction using Supervised ML In this task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves only 2 variables.
Here we are going to answer the question that,

what will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?
we are using Python3 to perform this task.

Dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data

## Task 2 Prediction Of Optimium Number Of Clusters.

Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning In this Task, we are going to perform Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning. For This Task, we will use Iris Dataset. Here we will Predict the Optimum Number Of Clusters and will represent it visually.
